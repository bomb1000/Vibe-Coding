# Financial News Aggregator Webpage

This project is a simple, responsive webpage designed to aggregate and display important financial news, with the initial concept of sourcing content from Twitter.

## Purpose

The goal is to provide a clean and easy-to-use interface for quickly viewing relevant financial updates.

## Technologies Used

## Current Status

*   **Responsive Design:** The page is designed to adapt to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Content Display:** Currently displays placeholder news data. The structure for fetching and displaying news items is in place.
*   **Styling:** Basic styling is applied for readability and a modern look.
